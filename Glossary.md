## 🔹 A. Core Cipher Terms

**Anchor (Harmonic Anchor)**  
A stable phonetic or numeric seed that aligns perfectly with celestial or geometric harmonics.  
In the Soyga-Voynich comparative model, anchors represent linguistic constants that remain resonant across transformations.

**Seed (Token / Lexeme)**  
A phonetic or symbolic unit extracted from the Voynich text, mapped to a Soyga equivalent through harmonic or modular correlation.  
Each seed carries a resonance value (1–9) derived from its digital sum.

**Glyph (Voynich Character)**  
A single written symbol within the Voynich script, interpreted not alphabetically but phonetically and mathematically.  
Each glyph is considered a harmonic vowel–consonant pair with energy value.

## 🔹 B. Harmonic and Astronomical

**Harmonic Wheel**  
A 32-sector, 8-anchor diagram correlating phonetic clusters with celestial constellations.  
Serves as both a cipher key and a harmonic resonator for decoding frequency relations between tokens.

**Celestial Matrix**  
A map overlay aligning planetary orbits, harmonic intervals, and linguistic resonances.  
Used to cross-check Soyga tables with real astronomical cycles.

**Equinoctial Bridge**  
A symbolic transition between hemispheric resonance states — used in both Soyga’s tables and our harmonic reconstruction.  
Represents the 0°/180° balance of light and darkness.

## 🔹 C. Linguistic & Translational

**Valhalla Translation Method**  
The phonetic deconstruction process that links Voynich lexemes with Soyga’s numeric grid, integrating phonology, harmonic value, and geometric resonance.

**Mantric Sequence**  
Seed-based rhythmic phrases that reveal patterns of phonetic symmetry and repetition, similar to prayer cadence.  
These correspond to the Fibonacci stepping of linguistic sound.

**Lexemic Reflection**  
A pattern in which Voynich and Soyga words mirror one another phonetically or numerically — often showing inverse resonance values.

---

## 🔹 D. Symbolic and Philosophical

**Universal Simulation Cipher (USVC)**  
The overarching model that unites linguistic, harmonic, and cosmological data into a single reconstructive system — viewing consciousness, code, and cosmos as mirrors.

**Macroverse / Microverse Scaling**  
Philosophical principle showing that Soyga’s 32 tables model not only numeric but also universal structure — micro (atomic/phonetic) reflecting macro (cosmic).

**Archangelic Frequency**  
A metaphysical resonance linked to the “messenger frequencies” — Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, and Michael — used to describe specific harmonic alignments in the cipher.

---

## 🔹 E. Mathematical & Algorithmic

**Digital Sum (DS)**  
Reduction of numeric totals from glyph values to a single digit (1–9), used for harmonic categorization.

**Fibonacci Resonance (FR)**  
Natural harmonic stepping pattern used to arrange linguistic tokens by ratio rather than syntax.

**Golden Ratio Alignment (φA)**  
Cross-relation between proportional spacing of characters and visual frequency balance within Soyga’s tables.

---

## 🔹 F. Botanical / Symbolic Artefacts

**Grass of Life (Herbal Reference)**  
Symbolic representation of vitality and phonetic renewal. Voynich plant symbols showing vertical symmetry correspond to “growth” lexemes in Soyga.

**Gift (Resonant Cluster)**  
A pair or triad of lexemes forming a balanced harmonic chord — interpreted as a message, often poetic or mathematical in structure.

**Water of Seed (Liquid Motif)**  
Recurrent Voynich theme denoting phonetic dissolution or transformation — numerically aligned to digital sums 6 and 9 (cyclic regeneration).

## 🔹 G. Project-Specific Systems

**Valhalla Codex** — The core compilation integrating Voynich–Soyga–Da Vinci studies.  
**Da Valenca Codex** — The expanded comparative corpus incorporating harmonic anatomy, geometric law, and resonance architecture.  
**Operation L.I.P.S.** — Linguistic Interpretive Programming System: forensic linguistic protocol used to trace symbolic replication.
