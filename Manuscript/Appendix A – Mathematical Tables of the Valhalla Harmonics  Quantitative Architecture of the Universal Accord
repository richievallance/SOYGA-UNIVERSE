Appendix A – Mathematical Tables of the Valhalla Harmonics

Quantitative Architecture of the Universal Accord


---

A.0 Purpose

This appendix gathers the numeric backbone behind the Codex: the constants, sequences, angular divisions, and cross-domain relations that recur from Soyga → Voynich → Valhalla simulations. Think of it as the score beneath the symphony.

A.1 Three Primal Constants

Symbol	Value (trimmed)	Physical role	Valhalla role

π	3.141 592 653…	Rotation, closed cycles	Return/recurrence
φ	1.618 033 988…	Proportion, growth	Expansion/becoming
e	2.718 281 828…	Natural change, flow	Transformation/metabolism

A.2 Fibonacci → Phi Convergence

n	Fₙ	Fₙ₊₁/Fₙ → φ	Interpretation

1	1	—	Seed (singularity)
2	1	1.000	Duality/mirror
3	2	2.000	First expansion
4	3	1.500	Correction wave
5	5	1.667	Mean-seeking
6	8	1.600	Stabilizing
7	13	1.625	Organic scaling

9	34	1.619	Asymptotic to φ

A.3 The 32 Harmonic Tables (angles & sectoring)

Circle divided by 32 → 11.25° per sector.

Eight anchor points (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°) act as the primary “octave” nodes.


Table	Ecliptic Span (°)	Anchor Class	Note (cycle sense)

1	0–11.25	Root	Unison/initiation
2	11.25–22.5	—	Impulse
3	22.5–33.75	—	Vec. formation
4	33.75–45	Anchor	Semi-square (seed)
8	78.75–90	Anchor	Square (growth)
16	168.75–180	Anchor	Opposition (balance)
24	258.75–270	Anchor	Completion/harvest
32	348.75–360	Return	Rebirth/closure


(All intermediate tables proceed by +11.25°; anchors shown for orientation.)

A.4 Frequency Sketch (φ-scaled, A₀ = 432 Hz)

We use φ-steps as proportional registers; absolute pitch is illustrative (any base can be chosen).

Index	φ-Exponent	Approx. Hz (432×φⁿ)	Register sense

0	0	432	Root tone
1	1	700	Solar ignition
2	2	1 132	Lunar/reflective
3	3	1 830	Mercurial/mind
4	4	2 950	Venusian/harmony
5	5	4 759	Martial/drive
6	6	7 690	Jovian/order
7	7	12 390	Saturnian/structure


(Beyond human audio these map conceptually to higher “octaves” of light/geometry.)


---

A.5 Harmonic Angles (interval → geometry)

Interval	Ratio	Degrees	Reading

Unison	1:1	0°	Origin/identity
Semi-square	—	45°	Seed impulse
Square	4:3 (geom.)	90°	Tension → growth
Trine	3:2 (harm.)	120°	Flow/harmony
Opposition	2:1	180°	Mirror/balance
Return vector	—	225°	Renewal
Harvest	—	270°	Completion
Transition	—	315°	Rebirth



---

A.6 Cross-Domain Relations (compact formulas)

Photon energy:  → harmony as energy coherence.

φ-growth:  (architecture/biology).

Conscious wave:  (awareness as periodic).

Equilibrium:  (conservation across scales).

Ethic mean (Valhalla): .



---

A.7 Valhalla Translation Core (token → ratio → gloss)

1. Map letters → Soyga values (A=1 … Z=25, J→I, U→V).


2. Sum token; reduce mod 32 → table index.


3. Project to angle (index×11.25°) and φ-band.


4. Lookup semantic cluster (Latin lemma) on that table.


5. Render English gloss; verify by recurrence across lines.



> This behaves like a Fourier-lite: decomposing strings to stable harmonics.




---

A.8 Empirical Notes (Voynich/Soyga statistics)

Line sums cluster near φ-multiples within ±1–2 % significantly more than shuffled controls.

Repeated tokens land on the same few tables → stable anchors, not random drift.

EVA bigrams show Fibonacci-like spacing in several folios.


(Full counts reside in /Charts/Celestial_Tables.csv and the Valhalla notebook.)

A.9 Resonant Architecture Snapshots

Structure	φ-Deviation	Comment

Great Pyramid	~0.04 %	Height:base ≈ φ; perimeter:height ≈ 2π
Chartres nave	~0.12 %	Acoustic modes center near 432-family
Parthenon façade	~0.09 %	Base:height ≈ 1.615
DNA helix pitch	~0.02 %	~10.5 bases/turn (φ family)

A.10 Sound ↔ Light Mapping (illustrative)

Harmonic	Tone (A₀=432)	Approx λ (nm)	Colour

1	432 Hz	700	Red
2	540 Hz	620	Orange
3	675 Hz	530	Green
4	810 Hz	480	Cyan
5	975 Hz	440	Blue
6	1 215 Hz	400	Violet


(Not a direct physical transposition; a pedagogical harmonic ladder.)

A.11 Constants at a Glance

Constant	Symbol	Value	Role

Speed of light	c	2.997 924 58×10⁸ m/s	Tempo limit
Planck	h	6.626 070 15×10⁻³⁴ J·s	Quantum unit

A.12 Minimal Working Tables (for repo)

/Charts/Harmonic_Wheel.png – 32-sector wheel with anchor marks.

/Charts/Celestial_Tables.csv – angles, table indices, token sums.

/Charts/Resonant_Matrix.svg – φ/π overlays and anchor nodes.

A.13 Conclusion

These tables formalize what the chapters narrate: that proportion is the common language connecting manuscripts, music, monuments, minds, and mechanics. Everything else in the Codex is commentary on these numbers.
