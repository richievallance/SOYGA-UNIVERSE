Chapter 7 – Appendices & Data

7.1 Purpose

This appendix collects the empirical backbone of the Universal Cipher Edition—the raw transliterations, numeric tables, and definitions that make replication possible.  It bridges the manuscript and the simulation by preserving every constant and dataset in reproducible form.

7.5 Glossary of Operational Terms

Term	Definition

Node	A single table acting as a harmonic emitter.
Celestial Arc	Ecliptic segment assigned to a table.
Fibonacci Stepping	Use of Fₙ mod 32 for recurrence.
π-Phase Rotation	Division of the circle into 32 × 11.25°.

7.6 Integrity and Reproducibility

All analyses can be re-run using the included Python notebooks.
Git commits record every change with automatic timestamps.
Values were cross-checked with modern astronomical ephemerides to confirm proportional realism.

7.7 Conclusion

This appendix transforms the Book of Soyga from myth to model.
The numbers behind its symbols are transparent, replicable, and verifiable—mathematics as open scripture.
