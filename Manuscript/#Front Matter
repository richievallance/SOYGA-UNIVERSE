Abstract

This edition restores and re-interprets the sixteenth-century Liber Soyga (Aldaraia) through modern analytical, mathematical, and computational methods.
The thirty-two enigmatic tables are revealed to constitute a coherent harmonic lattice whose governing constants — the Golden Ratio (φ), the circle constant (π), and the Fibonacci sequence (Fₙ) — encode recursive symmetry between language, geometry, and consciousness.
By treating each table as a node within a rotating φ-scaled matrix, the work demonstrates that Soyga expresses a proto-scientific vision of a self-organising cosmos.

The Universal Cipher Edition provides a transparent scholarly apparatus (textual reconstruction, numerical analysis, and appendices) together with the conceptual blueprint for the Universal Simulation Construct (USC) — a digital environment translating Soyga’s static geometry into living motion.
The project unites historical philology, data science, and metaphysical inquiry, proposing that proportion is the bridge between mind and matter.

Statement of Purpose

The edition has three goals:

1. Preservation — to digitise and stabilise all extant Soyga data.


2. Reconstruction — to rebuild its mathematical and astronomical framework.


3. Activation — to evolve those frameworks into a functional simulation linking text, number, and light.
