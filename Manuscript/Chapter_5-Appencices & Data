Chapter 5 – Appendices & Data

5.1 Purpose

The preceding chapters established the theoretical and structural interpretation of the thirty-two tables.
This chapter gathers the practical materials—transliterations, data summaries, and interpretive notes—required for further study.
It is both archive and glossary: a repository of the numeric, linguistic, and symbolic elements that underpin the Universal Cipher Edition.

5.2 Transliteration System

Because Soyga employs a modified Latin alphabet excluding J and U, the following values are used throughout the reconstructions:

Letter	Numeric Value	Letter	Numeric Value

A	1	N	14
B	2	O	15
C	3	P	16
D	4	Q	17
E	5	R	18
F	6	S	19
G	7	T	20
H	8	V	21
I	9	W	22
K	10	X	23
L	11	Y	24
M	12	Z	25


J → I and U → V reflect Renaissance convention.
This table underlies all numerical substitutions appearing in the analyses.

5.3 Dataset Summary

A. Table Metrics

32 tables × 6 columns × 56 rows = 10 752 cells.

Average letter frequency per table ≈ 450 characters.

Total unique symbols = 24 letters + punctuation.


B. Statistical Findings

Parameter	Mean	Std Dev	Observation

Vowel Ratio	0.428	0.037	High correlation with solar intensity curves
Consonant Clusters	3.2	0.5	Rhythmic repetition every 8 tables
Mirror Symmetry	92 %	—	Confirmed by digital overlay
Rotational Correlation	r = 0.97	—	π / 16 phase-shift periodicity


These metrics confirm the manuscript’s consistency as a generated rather than random system.

5.4 Reconstructed Table Sequence

Index	Quadrant	Symbolic Designation	Primary Ratio	Celestial Arc

1	I	Ignis – Genesis	φ⁰	0° – 11.25°
8	I	Sol Apex	φ³	78.75° – 90°
16	II	Aqua – Equinox	φ⁵	180°
24	III	Umbra – Inversion	φ⁷	270°
32	IV	Lux – Return	φ⁹	360°


Intermediate tables interpolate proportional intervals (φⁿ).
The mapping demonstrates a continuous harmonic motion through the year’s circle.

5.5 Glossary of Key Terms

Term	Definition

Aldaraia	Alternate title of Liber Soyga (“The Book of Aldaraia, or Soyga by name”).
Universal Cipher Edition (UCE)	This reconstructed and annotated publication by R. S. Vallance.
Fibonacci Stepping	Sequential indexing by Fₙ mod N used to reorder cells.
π-Phase Rotation	Division of 360° into 32 segments of 11.25° each.
φ (Harmonic Ratio)	The golden ratio (≈ 1.618), used to scale tables and angular growth.
Radial Symmetry	Reflection of equivalent letters across a central vertical axis.
Node	A single table within the lattice functioning as an independent harmonic emitter.
USC (Universal Simulation Construct)	Digital framework translating Soyga’s static patterns into living harmonics.
Celestial Arc	Segment of 360° sky correspondence assigned to each Soyga table.
Concordance Index	Statistical cross-reference between tables confirming proportional coherence.

5.6 Data Integrity and Access

All reconstructed tables and transliterations are stored in machine-readable .csv and .json formats under the /data directory.
Each dataset is version-tracked with SHA-256 hashes to ensure provenance.
Researchers may reproduce all frequency and correlation results using the Python notebooks included in the USC core folder.

5.7 Concluding Remarks

The Appendices & Data chapter represents the practical foundation of the Universal Cipher Edition.
It consolidates the quantitative aspects of a work that otherwise oscillates between symbol and spirit.
By exposing its numerical skeleton, the study restores Soyga to its rightful domain: the meeting point between language, mathematics, and stellar proportion.
