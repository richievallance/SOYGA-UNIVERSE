## 📖 Abstract
This edition presents a modern analytical reconstruction of the *Liber Soyga* (or *Aldaraia*), a sixteenth-century cryptographic manuscript reputed to encode angelic and cosmological knowledge.  
Through mathematical modelling, astronomical correlation, and symbolic analysis, the research identifies the thirty-two tables not as isolated magical grids but as an integrated **32 × 32 information lattice** aligned with Fibonacci stepping, π-phase ratios, and φ-spiral harmonics.  

By reassessing the text through both heliocentric and esoteric frameworks, this study argues that *Soyga* embodies a synthetic philosophy linking number, light, and consciousness.  
The **Universal Cipher Edition** brings together empirical computation and metaphysical interpretation, proposing that the tables function as a mnemonic engine bridging linguistic, mathematical, and stellar orders.
