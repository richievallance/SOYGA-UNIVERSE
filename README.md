### 🜂 Overview  
This repository forms the **unified digital manuscript** for the *Book of Soyga – Universal Cipher Edition* (USCE).  
It brings together the cross-referenced research between the *Book of Soyga*, the *Voynich Manuscript*, and the *Da Valenca Codex* to reconstruct a forgotten harmonic language — one that merges **mathematics, astronomy, music, and consciousness** into a single symbolic system.  

Each chapter expands on a major axis of inquiry:  
- 📜 Historical and linguistic reconstruction  
- 🔢 Mathematical correspondences and cipher tables  
- 🌠 Astronomical and harmonic mapping  
- 🧬 Computational, quantum, and cosmological analysis  
- 🜄 Comparative philosophy and sacred geometry

### 🧠 Research Scope  
The **Universal Cipher Edition** treats the Soyga and Voynich systems as *parallel harmonic constructs*, decoding them through:  

- Fibonacci stepping & π-phase ratios  
- Modular arithmetic and golden spiral alignments  
- Astronomical tables & constellation mapping  
- Heliocentric and lunar synchronisation  
- Resonant frequencies and musical cipher conversion  

The aim is to **restore the lost mathematical language of harmony** that underlies ancient calendars, geometries, and symbolic alphabets.
